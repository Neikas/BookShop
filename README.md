- [x]  the book may have a discount (by percentage), and I also would like to see that in the listing [10%]
- [x] Search bar when searching for a book it should look for title and author
- [x] lists them in the same layout as the landing page
- [x] a search bar must have a cookie that tracks the previous search you had
- [x] Menu bar
- [x] Login and registration button

- [x] must have a register button
- [x] Registration page

### Task 2 Books API and Dynamic Elements

# Create Public API

- [x] Create an endpoint /api/v1/books which would return the books list (only confirmed books), with pagination done by Laravel standards
- [x] Every book should return those fields: id, title, cover full URL, price, authors as string comma-separated, genres as string comma-separated
- [x] You need to use Laravel API Resources for this
- [x] Create an endpoint for a single book /api/v1/books/{id} and show the fields the same as in the list but also add Description field. But you need to use the same Laravel API Resource, just with the condition of when to add the description field or not.

# Post Rating/Review without Page Refresh

- [x] Logged in user can post rating/review, but it needs to be saved immediately on the same page and refresh the list of reviews and the average rating.
- [x] For that, choose your own technology that you want: Vue.js, Laravel Livewire. jQuery will do but not recommended.
- [x] If you choose Vue/jQuery, then on the back-end, there should be an API endpoint created to save review/rating (Authentication with Laravel Sanctum) that would return the full book data with reviews/ratings and then you show that data on the page
